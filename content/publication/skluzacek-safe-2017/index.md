abstract: The emergence of IoT devices is revolutionizing various aspects of human
  life, including healthcare, where the use of such devices can potentially improve
  health outcomes for millions. However, the efficacy of treatments and protocols
  based on IoT devices is measured through the use of rigorous double-blind studies,
  which can be quite expensive to conduct as they traditionally require a third party
  mediator. In this paper, we propose CATnIP, a secure, centralized cloud hub for
  instrumenting and conducting double-blind studies, with an extended focus on seamless
  integration with IoT devices. This paper outlines the construction and security
  considerations of CATnIP, the motivations behind creating such a system, and an
  evaluation based on the Five Safes and Stakeholder frameworks.
