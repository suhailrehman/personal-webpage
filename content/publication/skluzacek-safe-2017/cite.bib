 abstract = {The emergence of IoT devices is revolutionizing various aspects of human life, including healthcare, where the use of such devices can potentially improve health outcomes for millions. However, the efficacy of treatments and protocols based on IoT devices is measured through the use of rigorous double-blind studies, which can be quite expensive to conduct as they traditionally require a third party mediator. In this paper, we propose CATnIP, a secure, centralized cloud hub for instrumenting and conducting double-blind studies, with an extended focus on seamless integration with IoT devices. This paper outlines the construction and security considerations of CATnIP, the motivations behind creating such a system, and an evaluation based on the Five Safes and Stakeholder frameworks.},
