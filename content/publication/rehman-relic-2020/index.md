abstract: The ad-hoc, heterogeneous process of modern data science typically involves
  loading, cleaning, and mutating dataset(s) into multiple versions recorded as artifacts
  operated on by various tools within a single data science workflow. Lineage information,
  including the source datasets, data transformation programs or scripts, or manual
  annotations, is rarely captured, making it difficult to infer the relationships
  between artifacts in a given workflow retrospectively. We demonstrate RELIC, a tool
  to retrospectively infer the lineage of data artifacts generated as a result of
  typical data science workflows, with an interactive demonstration that allows users
  to input artifact files and visualize the inferred lineage in a web-based setting.
