abstract: We have designed, developed and administered a course on cloud computing
  that was taught to over 700 students at our institution over two years. The goal
  of this project-based course is to provide students with foundational systems concepts
  as well as experience in developing the required skills to design and deploy viable,
  robust and elastic web-services within performance and budgetary constraints. We
  present our objectives, learning outcomes, projects, learning model, outcomes and
  lessons learned. So far, for this demanding course, our student retention rate is
  above 80% and enrollment is doubling every year.
