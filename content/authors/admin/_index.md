I'm an Assistant Instructional Professor at the University of Chicago's <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://college.uchicago.edu/">The College</a>. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science under <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~aelmore/">Prof. Aaron J. Elmore</a>. I'm interested in systems for data science, specifically data lineage for usability and data discovery.

I have previously worked on:
* Cloud computing systems and Education at CMU.
* GPU Computing at <a href="https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/research/thesis/thesis-students/exploring-irregular-memory-access-applications-on-the-gpu">IIIT-Hyderabad</a>.
